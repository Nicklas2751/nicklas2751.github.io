https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank] is a popular open-source framework for integrating various systems and services. It provides a variety of components and tools to make it easier to integrate different systems, such as file systems, databases, and web services.

However, in some cases, it might be necessary to skip some lines in a file while processing it with https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank]. For instance, you might have a file that has some metadata in the first two lines, and you only want to process the actual data from the file.

In this article, I'll show you how to skip the first two lines of a file in https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank]. The solution can be applied to any type of message that's split by the `split` component, not just files.

== The Problem

When you're processing a file in https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank], it's possible to use the `split` component to split the file into separate messages, one message per line. However, if you want to skip some lines, such as the first two lines, you need a way to filter out those messages before they're processed.

== The Solution

https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank] provides a `filter` component that allows you to filter out messages based on a condition. The condition can be specified using the `simple` language, which provides a simple expression language for filtering messages.

To skip the first two lines of a file, we can use the `filter` component and check the value of the `CamelSplitIndex` property. This property is set by the `split` component and indicates the current index of the message in the split list.

Here's an example of how to skip the first two lines of a file in https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank]:


```java
from("file:input?noop=true")
.split().tokenize("\n")
.filter(simple("${exchangeProperty.CamelSplitIndex} > 1"))
.to("file:output");
```

In this example, we start by reading a file from the `input` directory using the `file` component. The `noop` option is set to `true`, which means that https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank] will not delete the original file after processing it.

Next, we use the `split` component to split the file into separate messages, one message per line. The `tokenize` option is set to `"\n"`, which means that the file will be split on newline characters.

After that, we use the `filter` component to filter out messages that have an index lower than or equal to 1. This will effectively skip the first two lines of the file.

Finally, we use the `to` component to write the filtered messages to the `output` directory.

== Conclusion

In this article, I showed you how to skip the first two lines of a file in https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank]. By using the `filter` component and checking the value of the `CamelSplitIndex` property, you can easily filter out the unwanted lines in a file. With https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel,window=_blank], it's possible to solve a variety of integration problems, and this is just one of the many examples.
